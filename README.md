# C-Video-Frame-Match

This repository hosts the C-Video-Frame-Match application, a C# tool designed to match images to video frames and assess their similarity. It's particularly useful for tasks where frame accuracy in video processing is critical, such as in surveillance or media analysis.

## Features

- **Load and Display**: The application allows users to load videos and images, and displays them within the UI.
- **Frame Matching**: Implements algorithms to match still images with frames from a video.
- **Similarity Check**: Evaluates and displays the similarity score between the image and video frames.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- .NET Framework
- Visual Studio (recommended for development)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahsanGoheer/C-Video-Frame-Match.git

2. Open the solution file (`Frame Checker.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage

- **Loading Content**: Use the UI buttons to load the video and the image files.
